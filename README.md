# Cify

A Rust crate implementing data and record types found in the [Common Interface File (CIF) format](https://wiki.openraildata.com/index.php/CIF_File_Format) used to exchange timetable information between [Network Rail](https://www.networkrail.co.uk/) systems.

This crate is being designed specifically to work with the [SCHEDULE](https://wiki.openraildata.com/index.php?title=SCHEDULE) data feed, which provides information on train timetables in the UK.
